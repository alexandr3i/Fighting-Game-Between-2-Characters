# Fighting Game Between 2 Characters (C++ OOP)

A **text-based console game** that simulates a battle between two characters: **the hero** and **the enemy**.  
Each character has at least one type of attack, and the player can also use a **consumable item** during the fight.

This project is written in **C++** and is structured as an **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** exercise.
